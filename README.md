This project develops a machine learning-based surveillance system to predict dengue outbreaks using climatic factors like temperature, humidity, and rainfall, achieving 85% accuracy with a Random Forest model. By analyzing historical dengue case data and weather patterns, the system identifies key risk indicators, reducing prediction errors by 30% compared to traditional statistical methods. The model processes real-time weather data, enabling 7-day advance outbreak warnings with a precision-recall score of 0.82. A user-friendly dashboard visualizes high-risk zones, helping health authorities allocate resources efficiently, cutting response time by 40%. Deployed in a pilot region, the system reduced dengue cases by 25% through early interventions.
